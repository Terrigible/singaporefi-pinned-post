# Starting Guide to FI

Been seeing beginner posts asking similar questions about how to start, so I'm looking to make one post about starting out, if anyone wishes to add on anything, please mention it in the comments

*Beginning*

**Emergency Funds / Bank account**

The first thing you should work on is an Emergency Fund, this would be liquid cash of about 6 months of expenses

The purpose of this fund would be to cover yourself and any dependents should a period of unemployment due to injury, illness, retrenchment or should any unforeseen event requiring cash immediately occur.

This Emergency Fund should be placed in a High Interest Savings account to accrue interest, ideally 2% P.A or higher.

At this moment of time the recommended savings account is Etiqa's Gigantiq (1.8% on first 10K for the first year)

After that there are a few options

&#x200B;

1. Syfe Cash+ with their *projected* 1.75% P.A
2. EndowUs CashSmart with their *projected* 1.6% P.A
3. SingLife (1.5% P.A)
4. StashAway Simple with their *projected* 1.4% P.A
5. Standard Charted JumpStart with fixed 0.4% on first 20K for those under 26
6. DBS Multiplier (Depends if you can fulfill the requirements)

**Update:** u/Vanilla_Interesting has an [updated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1xRB1I9gPaaTRUL-Z5nJ6Qx_TfenR_AOp/htmlview#gid=1948369204) of high interest savings accounts (updated June 2021)

Please do your own due diligence before using any of these products

**The process of saving**

A decent starting guide is 50/30/20 on how to allocate one's salary if

This means

* 50% of one's salary to daily expenses
* 30% for wealth accumulation (Stocks, ETFs, Roboadvisors, RSPs etc)
* 20% for savings/emergency fund

After a while it's not unusual to adjust the proportions as one sees fit

* Some who don't spend much can get by on 30% or less
* Some are more focused on investments can bump it to 50% or more
* Those who have enough savings can cut it down to 10%

Everyone has their own lives and different circumstances, so feel free to adjust it as you see fit if 50/30/20 doesn't work out

The reason why saving is so important is that one's savings rate is [just as important, if not even more important than market performance](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)

It is a good idea to keep track of one's financial position

* Tracking of expenses (Through various apps, bank transactions, recording manually)
* Savings rate (Is it enough/on track? Going up/down?)
* Net Worth (Reaching FI number?)

**FI Number**

What is the "FI Number"?

It is the net worth at which [one can retire and live off of indefinitely](https://www.firepathlion.com/my-never-have-to-work-again-number-the-safe-withdrawal-rate/)

This is the end goal for FI

A rough estimate will be when one's annual expenses is 3.33% of their financial capital.

A *Safe Withdrawal Rate* is the rate at which one can draw out their funds without running the risk of outliving their retirement fund

3.33% is a rather safe Safe Withdrawal Rate with and /u/kyith [talks this and other matters here](https://investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/how-much-do-you-need-for-financial-independence-or-retirement-a-simple-formula-to-guide-you/)  however, this is a deep topic that is worth reading more. I will just touch on it here as this is a starting guide

**Insurance**

Once again this will require your own due diligence

**Hospitalisation Insurance**

The most basic insurance is Hospitalisation Insurance, in Singapore you can look at the [Integrated Shield Plans](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans) (ISP)

Integrated Shield Plans will allow one to stay in Private, Class A and Class B1 wards during hospitalisation and have it be covered by their insurance, as opposed to only being to stay in Class B2 or C wards under MediShield

The premiums for ISP can be paid using MediSave up to the  Annual Withdrawal Limit, which would be $300. For those under 30, one can sign up for Private Hospital ISPs and have it totally covered by MediSave

One should sign up for an ISP as soon as possible due to the risk of pre-existing conditions, where an injury or illness that arose before signing up for it the insurance plan would not be covered by the plan

**Life Insurance/Total Permanent Disability**

The purpose of Life Insurance  and Total Permanent Disability (TPD) is to cover dependents in the event that the person insured passes away or suffers a crippling injury.

This is different from Hospitalisation Insurance as that covers hospital bills, whereas Life/TPD will pay out a lump sum of cash that can be used to cover costs of living (housing, utilities, food etc) for your dependents

*Term Vs Whole Life*

Term vs Whole life is a common question

*Term*: Think of this as a subscription service like Spotify or Netflix, where for as long as one pays the fees (premiums) one will be covered by the insurance policy, usually cheaper than Whole Life

*Whole Life*: Whole life plans are more complicated. The general idea is that one puts in money into the plan until they hit a certain amount and the money there will be used to cover them in the event of death/TPD at a multiplier. They are more expensive than Term Life plan and they usually offer the ability to draw money from the plan and a *projected* interest rate of 3.75% to 4.75%

Usually Term is recommended in FI circles as

1. It's cheaper, leaving more money available for investments
2. Even an average year in most index beats the projected 3.75% - 4.75%
3. It's simpler

For reference while these plans like to boast their projected 3.75%-4.75%, CPF offers **guaranteed 3.5%-5%** on your first 60K depending on whether it's your OA, SA or MA

These are the key insurance plans one should look for first, after ISPs and Life/TPD one can look at supplemental insurance plans like Early CI, Personal Accident etc as they see fit. I may do a more in depth post on insurance in the future

Once again please do your own DD before signing up for anything.

**For those who are still holding onto Aviva NS insurance plans**

These plans aren't necessarily bad but it is a *Group* plan, so if Aviva, Mindef or the Gov ever decides to change or terminate the plan one would have no say in the matter and would just have to accept it.

Additionally while the Group Term Life plan is pretty cheap, one can find even more affordable plans at [CompareFirst](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/homeEvent.action) if they are young, so it's a good idea to compare the prices if you're not sure which is best, especially if one is looking to bundle in a Critical Illness rider.

The Group Personal Accident is very cheap and other personal, so even though I don't really do any dangerous activities I keep it and max it out for like $72 a year

[Update: I have a more comprehensive guide on insurance here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/?)

One might wonder why I decide to cover these topics, particularly insurance.

The reason is that when it comes to investing, one needs to be able to buy and hold, especially during more turbulent markets, in fact, if one might want to invest more in a downturn.

However, if one does not have a strong financial foundation, during a downturn they might be forced to sell at a loss to meet their needs which is the absolute worst case scenario. Just because the economy is in a downturn doesn't decrease the chances of illness or accident occurring.

Therefore I believe it is important to secure oneself before investing

**Investing**

One of the most popular investing strategies is to invest in Index Funds, which are made of dozens, hundreds or thousands of individual stocks, thereby buying the whole market.

FirePathLion has a post explaining Index Funds [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/a-bet-on-humanity-why-index-investing-works/) and the 3 Fund Portfolio by John Bogle followed by most of the FI community is covered by FirePathLion [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/)

Full Disclosure: Personally, I prefer investing in Global Index Funds like SWRD,IWDA,VWRA and EIMI, I wrote about the best broker for these funds over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ggzs7v/best_broker_to_invest_in_swrdiwdaeimi_i_did_the/)

For those seeking to invest in any specific markets I am afraid I do not feel confident enough to offer advice regarding that

These funds are broad global index funds that cover either developed (SWRD/IWDA), developing markets (EIMI) or both (VWRA). I talk a bit about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/gkybeh/swrdiwda_eimi_or_vwrdvwra_a_breakdown/)

However, how one decides to invest is purely up to the individual, what stocks they wish to invest in and in what proportion is entirely up to them, what I am writing here are recommendations based on general consensus and my personal understanding

According to the 3 fund portfolio, the percentage of stocks be \[110-(your age)\]. So for example, a 20 year old would be 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds (ABF bonds).

Out of this 90% of stock if one were to follow the 3 fund portfolio, one would invest half of it, so 45% in foreign stocks like SWRD/IWDA/VWRA/EIMI and the other 45% in the STI.

However it is not uncommon to modify the formula to suit their preferences such as by

1. Going 100% in stocks
2. Reduce their allocation in STI to 10% of total holdings
3. Investing in VOO/SPY directly

Which Index to invest in heavily depends on how much one is able to commit to investmenting monthly. I assume one would be familiar with the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).

*100-500/month* : Straits Times Index/ABF SG Bonds/MBH Bonds via POSB Invest-Saver/ FSMone RSP or US via Robo Advisors

At this amount fees are the biggest concern when it comes to investing

E.g, If one invests $100 per month and pays $3 in fees, so $97 is actually invested. If the stock goes up by 7% that year, their final amount would be 107% X $97 = $103.79,  a real increase only 3.79% on the principal amount!

From what I gather, optimally, one should not pay more than 0.2-0.3% in fees

At this point the best one can really hope for is under 1% in fees

STI isn't the greatest index, but it is the most accessible for our purposes, providing a [7% return](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-ultimate-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-11-year-returns-of-the-sti-etf-part-2-rolling-internal-rate-of-returns/) which is Ok

Robo Advisors are basically brokers that allow one to buy into a mix of funds, at a predetermined ratio automated with the use of an algorithm, usually at low costs, more details [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/robo-advisors-vs-diy-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/)

*600-2000/month*:

Hold onto the investment money and invest Quarterly, Bi-Annually or Annually  (I would recommend Standard Chartered as the fees would be approx 10USD with no custodial fees)

At this point if one is under 26 they can start looking at Interactive Brokers as they only charge 3USD in management fees and these fees will be waived if the commissions for that month exceed 3USD.

*More than 2000/month*:At this point one can start looking at investing directly on a monthly basis as the fees from using Interactive Brokers is similar to using that of a Robo-Investor

*Lump Sum Investing*

There have been a few posts asking how to invest a lump sum or where to invest a lump sum.

The best answer would be to do their own reading on personal finance and investing, decide what they wish to invest in and allocate accordingly

Some recommended Index Funds that I personally invest in or looking to invest in are SWRD and EIMI

However in the end, nothing can beat an individuals own DD when it comes to investing
