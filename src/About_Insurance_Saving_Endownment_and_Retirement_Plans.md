## About Insurance Saving, Endownment and Retirement Plans

I have been seeing various posts asking for help regarding ILPs, Whole Life Insurance, Endowment plans or other Investment/Savings plans.

So I decided to make a post about these plans.

The general consensus of this sub is that these plans are bad and should be avoided at all costs. If one happened to buy into these plans they should get out ASAP, even if at great cost. I generally agree with this sentiment.

I will go into more detail about these plans and do case studies based on previous posts on this sub.

Feel free to submit more case studies based on posts that I missed or your own personal situation.

*Disclaimer: When I refer to "Stock Markets" I wil be referring to the US S&P 500 as it has the most detailed information I could find. I understand that the "Stock Market" is more than just the US and S&P500 but given its size and prevalence in the global stock market I decided it's use as an example acceptable*

# 1. Why these plans are sub-optimal

While many of these plans boast certain benefits, they are plenty of possible counter-arguments

&#x200B;

|"Benefit"|Counter-Argument|
|:-|:-|
|Guaranteed Return of \~3%|Many of these plans have lock-periods of 20 years or more. However stock markets have [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/). CPF already provides guaranteed returns of 2.5% to 5%|
|Can act as an Emergency Fund (either now or in the future)|A personal Emergency Fund should already be set up before investing. Keeping an emergency fund with institutions that require applications to withdraw funds from kind of defeats the purpose. A good Emergency Fund should be one that is *immediately accessible* with *minimal restrictions*|
|It will not go down if the stock market crashes|These plans also invest in the stock market, but with their non-guaranteed and guaranteed returns they can control how much they pay back to keep themselves afloat at the policy holders expense. The stock market always recovers from a crash and eventually exceeds it. A portfolio can also be weighted so that it doesn't suffer too greatly from a crash.|
|The money in one's CPF has restrictions and faces policy risk|These plans have their own restrictions too. While they may not have policy risk in terms of government policy changes, companies can change policies too. Unlike a government, which is at least generally accountable to its people, a company is mainly accountable to its shareholders, not its customers. Additionally,the SG government is probably lot more stable and reliable than a single financial institution, in terms of chances of facing bankruptcy, liquidation, etc|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Cons|Elaboration|
|:-|:-|
|Lock-In periods|If one needs to draw out the money early, a large amount will be charged as a "surrender fee". If a person invests for themselves, one can withdraw their own investments anytime with minimal fees.|
|Poor returns (3.25% to 4.75%)|As mentioned, even CPF can guarantee similar if not better returns for free. ETFs can also provide [7% over the long run](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/s-p-500-returns-to-halve-in-coming-decade-8211-goldman-sachs-59439981). It may not seem like much but 2% makes a big difference over the long term (Experiment with it [here](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)). Additionally, these are only *projected returns* and many plans fall far short|
|Lock in Period + Low returns|This is one issue that comes up particularly because these two aspects overlap. Some might argue that "such plans act as a back-up in case one's investments don't work out". However, since these plans usually have some form of restriction requiring the money to be kept for at least 20 or more years. If a person were to invest in global, low cost index funds and keep investing for a similar period of time, they would have higher returns with minimal risk|
|Fees|Many of these plans are subject to various fees (Agent fees, Fund fees, Management fees etc), generally between 1-2%, if not more. These are huge compared to fees if one DIYs. Many Robos can provide investments with fees totaling less than 1%|

&#x200B;

The most optimal situation would be if one of these plan can guarantee \~3% after 10 years with minimal restrictions but none of these plans can do that

As such there is only one demographic who truly benefits from these plan.

Individuals who have no knowlege of personal finance with no intention to learn how to manage their own finances. Who would spend all their money if they were not forced to do otherwise.

(I know this sounds harsh but I honestly believe this is the case)

I'm rather certain anyone on this subreddit falls outside this demographic

# 2. Alternatives for the risk adverse

If one wants the convenience and automation these plans offer, Roboinvestors provide investment services with pretty solid returns and have portfolios that provide more stability if one is risk averse at a fraction of the costs

For those who want to be more hands on they can tailor their own portfolio with a 50/50 or even 40/60 stock-bond allocation will which will remain highly stable and still offer significant returns.

Example: If one bought an equal amount of VWRA and A35 right before the crash at\~1000USD/1300SGD) (Assuming an exchange rate of 1 USD:1.3 SGD for simplicity)

&#x200B;

|Securities|Value on 21/02/2020|Value on 29/03/2020|Value 25/6/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VWRA|962.50 USD (11 Shares  at 87.50USD)|732.38 USD (11 Shares  at 66.58 USD)|1238.16 USD (11 Shares  at 112.56 USD)|
|A35|1300 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.2070 SGD)|1308.56 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.2150 SGD)|1276.25 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.1850 SGD)|
|Total Portfolio Value|\~2251.25 SGD|\~2260.66 SGD|\~2885.86 SGD ( +26.27 SGD of dividends)|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 3. Mindset - Sunk Cost Fallacy

Getting over Sunk Cost fallacy is necessary to make the correct decision.

If one has already bought into these plans and put money into it, one should be ready to let go of that money and consider it "lost".

It has already been put in and nothing can be done to undo it.

The most important thing is to look at the current situation objectively and avoid losing more money in the future.

# 4. Case Studies

I have included some recent posts involving such plans here as a case study

*All OPs have given permission for their posts to be discussed here*

[**Case Study 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/o6q6uh/thoughts_about_insurance_endowment_plans/)  (Savings Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $2000
* Duration invested: 2 years
* Remaining duration: 23 years
* [AIA Smart Rewards Saver (II)](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/savings/aia-smartrewards-saver-(ii).pdf)

By their own [illustration](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/savings/aia-smartrewards-saver-(ii).pdf) (Pg 3) if a person pays $71.12 per month for 25 years, their best projected scenario of 4.75% shows a $23,505 payout and their lower end estimate of 3.25% is $21,240.

Howeve, there is no actual guarantee that the person will receive $21,240.

The only guaranteed payout is $12,000

Over those 25 years, the holder would have put $21,336 into the plan.

So at the end of 25 years, one could actually receive *less money than they put in*.

&#x200B;

***Compared to a High Interest Savings Account/Money Market Funds***

If an Emergency Fund is needed, one should open a savings account, ideally a high interest one from the list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1xRB1I9gPaaTRUL-Z5nJ6Qx_TfenR_AOp/htmlview#gid=1948369204) by u/Vanilla-Interesting (Updated as of June 2021)

The interest rates may not be as high as the "*projected returns"* from such plans, but its purpose is to act as a reliable, accessible store of funds to tide one over without worrying about red tape, surrender fees or withdrawal limits.

The high interest rates are a nice bonus but *not* its main draw

Alternatively Money Market Funds such as [EndowUs CashSmart](https://endowus.com/cash-smart) and [StashAway Simple](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple), these plans invest the money in generally safe and stable funds and provide projected interest rates of between 0.7% - 2%

For reference AIA and other companies also invest the funds such plans, however, StashAway and EndowUs are more transparent, listing their holdings on their pages [here](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple) and [here](https://endowus.com/cash-smart)

For MMFs, their *worst case scenario* falls just short of the *best* projected interest rates of the Savings Plans. The best case scenarios for MMFs far exceed those of Savings Plans and without their restricitons

&#x200B;

||AIA Savings Plans|Money Market Fund|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Best Case| $23,505 (4.75%)| $27,335.94 (2%)|
|Worst Case| S$21,240  (3.25)| $23,228.22  (0.7%)|

*As how 0.7% returns in a MMF exceed the returns of 3.25% of AIA Savings Plans, the answer is most likely from all the fees charged by the plan. Unable to confirm without actual policy documents*

So Money Market Funds come with **far more upsides** and **far fewer downsides**

One might argue that it is a savings plan, so it is supposed to force the holder to save and not offer great returns

But it can't guarantee the amount returned is equal to the amount put in. This would be unacceptable from any bank account

And assuming OP needed the $2000 they put in for some emergency expense today, there is no guarantee they can get the all money out, making it useless as an emergency fund.

One might argue that if OP surrenders the plan now, they will lose $2000 as compared to riding the plan to maturity and not losing it

However, if OP is going  to put  $71.12 per month in aside and leave it untouhed for 23 years, they may as well invest it.

For the same action of not touching it for 23 years, they can potentially get a much higher return. And historically speaking, the stock market has [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/).

This Savings Plan can't even guarantee it will return the same amount of money put into it

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[**Case Study 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/nryj84/insurance_investment_policy_vs_stocketf/h0jo7mv/)  (Insurance Saving Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $4800
* Duration invested: 2 years
* Remaining duration: 8 years
* [PruWealth II](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-ii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx)

If what OP says is true about " *first 2/10 years will be taken by the insurance company* " this plan is already off to a bad start

This is due to the effects of compound interest where the money that is deposited earliest has the potential to compound the most and is therefore the most valuable. By taking this money first, the company does not only take out 20% of the money deposited, but the money that has the most room to grow

But going back to their own [brochure](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-ii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx), in the scenario they give, the person deposits $5000/year for 10 years and then leaves it alone for 20-35 years

&#x200B;

***Compared to a Investing in Stock Markets directly***

||After 20 years|After 35 years|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PruWealth II - 4.75%|$136,343|$251,156|
|PruWealth II -  3.25%|$93,145|$152,279|
|[100% S&P 500 - 7%](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/)|$267,008|$736,684|
|[60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio - Worst Case Scenario (4.37%)  Sep 2000 - Aug 2015](http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/us-stocks-rolling-returns/)|$143,431|$272,445|
|[60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio - Best Case Scenario (18.21%)   Aug 1982 - Jul 1997](http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/us-stocks-rolling-returns/)|$3,367,504|$41,411,544|

*Using 15 year rolling returns as it was the best data I could find.*

*Included Index funds at 7% as a baseline as the 60/40 Best Case Scenario was from 1982-1997, which may be too long ago to still be relevant*

&#x200B;

Even their own best case scenario is barely more than half what one can expect after 20 years of investing in Index Funds. After 35 years, Index Funds far surpass them.

Even the worst 15 year period of a 60/40 mix of Stocks/Bonds kept ahead of their own best case scenario

This plan has been replaced with a newer version [PruWealth III](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-iii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx) , but it's pretty much the same thing

So, while OP may lose $4800, it is worth cancelling the plan as the future long term losses will far exceed that amount

*About how the Worst Case scenario (4.37%) provides higher returns than PruWealth II (4.75%), I believe it is due to a mix of the first 2 years being taken as fees and additional fees by the company. Unable to confirm without actual policy documents*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[**Case Study 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/n3nf5k/retirement_plan_with_insurer_should_i_continue/) (Retirement Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $6000
* Duration invested: 1 year
* Remaining duration: 19 years
* [Aviva MyRetirement Choice](https://www.aviva.com.sg/content/dam/aviva-public/sg/documents/aviva-retirement-plan/Aviva_MyRetirementChoice.pdf)

From OP's post the plan works like so

* Pay $500 a month for 20 years into the plan
* Let the plan "mature" for 5-10 years
* The plan will pay out $900 a month to OP between 60 - 80y/o

Since this plan is targeted at providing retirement income, I'll compare it to CPF

***Compared to CPF***

*I will be assuming the money is placed in CPF-SA account with a 4% interest rate. Assuming the worst case scenario where there is* [*no bonus interest of up to 2%*](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates)

If the same amount of money had been placed in CPF SA, for the same duration, after the plan ends when the holder turns 81 y/o, there would be a remainder of $154,694. There are no mention of a payout

Not to mention CPF LIFE provides payouts [for life](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/retirement/cpf-life/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=CPF%20LIFE&folderid=11646&ajfaqid=2186326)

And while there is no mention of what would happen to the plan if the holder passes away, CPF LIFE states that [premium balances will be paid to beneficiaries if the holder passes away](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/CPF-LIFE/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=CPF%20LIFE&folderid=11684&ajfaqid=2186431)

This is not even considering the [tax relief from topping up one's CPF](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF-Cash-Top-up-Relief/)

The policy does include an additional payout upon Severe Disability, but the requirements are the same as [CareShield Life](https://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/careshield-life/careshield-life-claims.html) , additionally one should already be covered by their own insurance or own funds at that point

One may argue that there is policy risk with putting said funds in CPF with the government

However, putting said funds with a single insurance company which may leave Singapore, close down or change policies over the course of 25 years has its own risks and restrictons too

And one may at least argue that the government is at least somewhat accountable to its citizens

If an insurance company really decides to alter the policy, the only possible actions one can take is attempt to lawyer up and attempt to solve it in court

And if a company does do that, they most likely would have their legal department prepared, with far greater resources, legal advice and time to drag out the issue

&#x200B;

OP and some commenters did suggest it was a way to diversify or to hedge against against their investments dd not work out

However, giving the minimum duration of 25 years and maximum duration of 45 years, the global stock market will certainly go up in that time

As mentioned, the stock market has [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/)

Using rolling returns of the S&P 500 (the best info I could find), the Annualized return over various periods are

||20 years|30 years|40 years|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Best Case Scenario|13.2% (1980)|10.1% (1932)|8.8% (1933)|
|Worst Case Scenario|0.6% (1920)|4.3 (1965)|4.2% (1969)|

&#x200B;

And if the global economy was really in such a slump, I doubt that any portfolio manager can generate positive returns after all the fees charged by the company.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[**Case Study 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/l5y47w/should_i_surrender_my_aia_endowment_plan/)  (Endowment plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $19,200
* Duration invested: 10 years
* Remaining duration: 2 years
* Maturity Duration: 12 years
* Surrender value: \~$10,000
* Guaranteed Sum: \~$30,000
* Non-guaranteed sum: \~$53,000
* [AIA Smart Growth Plan](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/savings/aia-smart-growth-ii-brochure.pdf)

This case is a bit different as OP is already 10 years into a 12 year Endowment plan. After another 2 years of contributions and leaving it to mature for another 12 years the payout will be between $30K-$53K

If OP were to surrender the plan, they would only receive \~$10K

Assuming the \~$10K and all future contributions were invested in Index Funds at 7%, and left to mature for 12 years, OP would expect \~$31K in returns.

This is pretty similar to the guaranteed payout of the Endowment plan and the endowment plan *may* pay out more than that.

So in this case it may be worth it to keep the plan. Especially since OP mentions " *monthly premium would only be less than 3% of my salary so I won’t be struggling to pay the premiums* "

The only downside is that OP will be unable to tap into the money if they need it, but if they manage their other funds and finances well it shouldn't be an issue.

So in this case, keeping the plan may be the "least bad choice"

&#x200B;

# Additional Reading

Our Moderator u/kyith also made a post [regarding such plans](https://investmentmoats.com/budgeting/do-your-insurance-saving-plans-endowment-give-you-3-to-5-returns/)

He examined a few plans with varying results, the worst returned -11%, the best \~5% and most returned 3-4% over \~20 years

&#x200B;

# Possible ways out: [Surrendering a plan to 3rd parties](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/mjoc6g/surrendering_insurance_savings_plan_to_third/)

This is something that I did not know about prior to writing this post.

It may be viable to some individuals, so I will mention it here

However there may be some restrictions.

Apparently, they require at *35% of the of the total premium to be paid already*

So for those who just got into a plan, this may not be possible, but for those a ways in, it might be worth looking into

**Please do your own Due Diligence as it is far beyond my circle of competence**

# Conclusion

Generally, if you're on this subreddit, you're probably better off doing your own saving, investment and retirement planning

These plans may have been acceptable 20 years ago when access to investments such SPY, IWDA, VWRA, EIMI was expensive and difficult

But today, with access and knowledge of financial planning,investments and investment tools so available, these plans are suboptimal at best and predatory at worst
