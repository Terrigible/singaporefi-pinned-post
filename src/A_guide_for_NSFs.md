# A guide for NSFs

*(Please do inform me if there are any things I missed out on)*

Many of us remember being young NSFs, being introduced to new concepts, including Personal Finance and feeling a bit lost

This post attempts to be a guide for NSFs, it will not cover everything but I hope it will provide a foundation to establish a better understanding and avoid common pitfalls

It will not make any NSF rich by the time they ORD, but I hope with this guide one will end their NS with a some funds to start their PF journey and not make any costly long term decisions

&#x200B;

# Lesson 0: Don't buy any Insurance/Savings/Investment plans

NSFs have long been a target of Insurance Agents/Financial Consultants to sell their plans to

They are aware NSFs do not generally have financial knowledge and are looking for help to manage their funds

A quick search on the subreddit will show that almost everyone that has bought some kind of plan from a bank/insurance company has regretted and ended up losing money

It is far for productive to learn how to manage your money yourself

Please do not sign up for anything you do not 100% understand

Saying "No", is always a valid option

# 1. Savings

While food and lodging may be covered during one's NS, it is always good to have an Emergency Fund in the event of personal or family emergencies

An emergency fund should be approximately 3-6 months of one's *monthly expense*

These funds should be readily and easily accessible and thus is recommended to be kept in a bank account and be tied to a Debit Card

This is simple and viable for one starting out on their personal finance journey

&#x200B;

For those with more funds (>$5000) and looking to optimize read below

***I have blocked it out to reduce information overload, come back when ready***

>!If one really wishes to optimize, there are services like Dash PET and EasyEarn that are similar to a bank account and offer a higher interest rate (1.3% and 1.8%) compared to banks (Appox 0.2%)!<

>!The downsides is that it may be a more inconvenient to withdraw money and they charge a withdrawal fee ($0.70 per withdrawal)!<

>!But if one's funds are gonna be parked in an account anyway, might as well put it in the account that gives the most interest!<

>!Please do your own due diligence when choosing such services and choose what is most comfortable for yourself!<

>!It may take a while to withdraw the money from this account,  it is best to have some funds in one's savings account in case of immediate cash needs and to use the funds in DashPet for more long term events!<

>!A few recommended accounts by u/Vanilla\_Interesting here!<

>!You may have come across POSB SAYE and its listed 2% interest rate, but do note that in order for one to benefit from it no withdrawal must be made from the account!<

**Credit Card**

It may be a good idea to sign up for a credit card to build a good credit score. This is provided one is able to control their spending.

*To be eligibile for a Credit Card one must be above 21 years old and be studying (DBS LiveFresh)*

Having a credit card is optional. It may be a good idea to build one's credit rating as long the card is paid in full, on time, everytime and one spends within their limits. Being able to benefit from the cash back would also be a upside

If spending or money management is a concern, a debit card will be just fine

# 2. Insurance

During NS one will be physically exerted and examined at levels they have not experienced before

It is not unheard of to develop/discover some new illness during NS

As such it good to pick up insurance as soon as possible to avoid having insurance plans consider them pre-existing conditions and not cover them

While I may have said not to buy insurance plans from agents, in this case we are looking to buy specific plans which serve specific purposes

It will cost money that may otherwise be invested, but I feel that building a strong foundation and protecting oneself is important

I have a comprehensive guide to insurance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/)

**Hopital Insurance**

Things that are particularly important are Hospital Insurance (Integrated Shield Plans)

These plans would cover a portion of one's bills upon hospitalisation

For those in their 20s, premiums (Annual Costs) will be between $200 - $400, depending on exact age and coverage (A, B1, B2, C Class or Private)

Fortunately, the premiums can be paid using Medisave and upon enlistment, there will be a $200 Medisave top up and another after 1 year into NS

This will minimize out of pocket costs

There is usually an option for a Rider (Add on) that will cap how much one will need to pay (Co-Pay), this will need to be paid for in cash though

If one can afford it, it is good to have, but if it is unaffordable or not keen to have it it is Ok

**Life Insurance**

One may be presented with Aviva Group Term Life plan while in NS

It has pros and cons

Pros: Other Insurance plans may not cover NS incidents

Cons: More expensive

It is optional if one does not have any major financial obligations

**Personal Accident**

The Aviva Group Term Accident however, is quite a good plan and I currently have it and have maxed out my coverage on it

# 3. Investing

For those who are not familiar with Investing, I suggest reading up on the resources in the [Subreddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index) or the [Personal Finance reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist)

The investment style that is generally advocated for is the [BogleHead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/) method. It involves buying the widest possible variety of stocks to minimize risk and maximize exposure and holding them for as long as possible to give it the longest time to grow

This plays to your main advantage, ***time***. NSFs are generally young and can have incredibly long investment horizons (30-50 years) and which allows their assets to benefit from compound interest

I am unable to fully explain the specifics in a guide like this, learning and understanding this will require reading on your own part

The [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index), the [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index#wiki_books_.28from_r.2Ffinancialindependece.29) liste there and the resources on r/personalfinance

In terms of which Broker to use, IBKR is strongly recommended as it has access to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and has Irish-Domiciled low cost index funds such as VWRA. You may have come across posts mentioning that it is more expensive as it has a USD$10 Monthly Activity Fee but rest assured those fees have been waived

Other brokers such as Tiger, MooMoo and TD Ameritrade may be an option and they may have slightly lower fees which might benefit you

Full disclosure, I use IBKR, as a sign of goodwill that I am not recommending them to share my referral code,after this post goes up I will not be sharing my code to anyone to ensure no conflict of interest after this post goes up

On Crypto/Forex/Options/Day trading, these terms may or may not be familiar now, but someone will inevitably mention them once or twice during NS

These investment vehicles are all more complicated than they first appear and I strongly advise you research them before starting them.

In comparison, the BogleHead strategy, is simpler and more straightforward than all of these other methods, if you aren't willing to do the research to understand it, it is unlikely you will do enough research to implement these others adequately

*Currently, one may notice crypto posts on the subreddit  where they are concerned with their losses and if they will be able to recover, in contrast, on the passive investing subreddit* r/Bogleheads, *users are generally quite calm and relieved to be passive investors. In fact, many are happy for the opportunity to buy investments at a lower price*

Forgive me for the next section of cliche advice

Other than financial investments, the other greatest invest one can make is in themselves. Learn some skills, get fit, make connections, build good habits. Even if one is assigned to an admin role, if they can get good at Excel, Presenting and other soft-skills, thats a pretty good asset to bring to your workplace/school after ORD

Nothing in NS really matters all that much, so making mistakes (Nothing too foolish) is Ok

Other things

* You may be offered to purchase SAFRA membership during BMT, don't its not worth it
  * They may offer a free gift that seems to cover the cost if you sell it
  * In my case it was a watch, but others were also selling it cheaper
* You may be offered to buy magazine subscriptions (Time, The Economist etc) during BMT
  * Don't buy it, read the digital version on NLB for free
